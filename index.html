    The report finds the good website has some flaws and the wrong website has some good parts.</p>
<!-- Introduction --> 
  <h2 class="heading2" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Website has been at the forefront of the internet. The first website was created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN and launched on August 6, 1991 (Web Foundation, n.d.). Website invented because Tim Berners-Lee frustrated when he needs to go to check every computer to find pieces of information, he wants which takes much time to find information that store in many different computers. Tim Berners-Lee purposed the technology of information management or now called the world wide web or the web. </p>
    <p>Website is a collection of webpages. Commercial, education, and also personal use website as a way to deliver their goal and vision to the massive just by typing the URL in the browser, user can see the page. </p>
    <p>A website is consist of HTML (hypertext markup language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. These are the programming language of the web. In a simple term, HTML is the structure of the web page such as the position of the text, the CSS is the styling such as the colour, and JavaScript is to move or animate elements.</p>
    <p>A good website consists of the overall design and functionality, such as the clarity and simplicity of the website (Vintage Agency, 2019). It also covers the contents of the website being delivery (Does Your Website Have What It Takes? n.d.). However, a successful website tends to have a solid defined goal which helps to bring out the purpose of the website, outstanding user experience in term of the usability on the website and the uptime where the sites functionality running as is intended to all the time it loaded (Morris, 2018). Besides, a successful website delivered what the audience expected and fulfil their needs.</p>
    <p>A failure website tends not to have a clearly defined goal of why it is made. The target audience, on the other hand, is not entirely researched as stated in Vintage agency website (2019). However, design and overall functionality such as navigation, and user experience also contribute to a failed website. </p>
    <p>This report will be reviewing two of good websites and two of bad website. These websites reviewed based on the four factors, the content, navigation, design, uniqueness, and technologies.</p>
<!-- Methodology --> 
  <h2 class="heading2" id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
    <p>The method of reviewing the four sites based on content, usability and design, uniqueness, and technologies.</p>
    <p>Websites reviewed with a chrome browser. Note that the chrome browser has no third-party plugins installed such as AdBlock to block ads or other elements in a website. It is to make sure, all the website elements are visible and to avoid any of error.
       The computer screen that used for displaying the website is with a resolution of 1440 x 900. 
  
    <h3>The description of the four criteria are:</h3>
    <p>1.The content or web content is anything that embedded to the site such as the text, images, video and links, the description of the product or services, and the social media link if present on the website, the right message or the first impression when accessing the website.</p>
    <p>2.The usability and design are where the website convey its purpose and the style that it represent. An eye-catching design gain the feeling of pleasure of using the website (Favian 2009). Furthermore, simplicity such as navigation and easy to read to decrease distractions. High-quality images are vital in today's era where screen becoming denser with a pixel that in turn, increase the user visibility and engagement in any particular part of the site.</p>
    <p>3.The uniqueness of the website gives a value that many useful websites have it owns speciality that differentiates them.</p>
    <p>4.The technologies that a website must have at least these three things. The CMS (Content Management System), CDN (Content delivery network) and web analytic. CMS is a management system that will manage the entire website, such as the blog post, products, multimedia, plugins, frameworks (SkyRocket Group, 2020). CDN is essential in improving access to the website globally and to prevent any DDOS (distribute denial of service) attack (What are the benefit of a cdn, n.d.). Lastly is the web analytic, is the method of collecting data from website traffic to be analysed to gain insight that can be useful for website improvement (Hughes, 2019). The technology that some bad website has is the Flash player that is clunky and usually force the user to install. Most websites now built-in HTML5 that supported by many browsers which have replaced flash (Griggs, 2020).</p>
  
<!-- MSY -->

  <p>JB HI-FI established in 1974, and it is now the most prominent stores that offer the most extensive range of games, home appliances, music, DVD, and so much more (Jbhifi.com.au).</p>

  <img src="image/heroJbhifi.png" alt="hero" style="width:100%">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <img src="image/menuJbhifi.png" alt="Dropdown Menu" style="width:100%">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
